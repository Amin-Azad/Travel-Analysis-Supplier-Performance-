## How to Use This Project

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone [https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git](https://github.com/Amin-Azad/Travel-Analysis-Supplier-Performance-)
2. Open the .pbix file in Power BI Desktop
3. Check/repair data source path if needed

5. Interact with the slicers (Year, Region, Category, Supplier, etc.)

## Key Insights Delivered

1. 75%+ of spend tied to top 10 suppliers
2. Late booking & non-preferred supplier usage drive €4.4M non-compliant spend
3. Operations & Sales are the highest cost departments
4. Flight category produces highest CO₂ emissions (~5K tons)
5. Most sustainable opportunity lies in booking earlier & switching to preferred suppliers

## Business Recommendations (High-Impact)

1. Enforce early booking (≥15–30 days) to reduce cost & improve compliance

2. Shift spend toward preferred suppliers to reduce non-compliant cost

3. Reevaluate contracts with low NPS or high SLA suppliers

4. Promote virtual meetings for high-CO₂ trip purposes

5. Optimize top spend categories (Flight, Hotel, M&E) with strategic sourcing

6. Improve travel policy messaging across high-risk departments

## Conclusion

This project transforms complex travel data into clear and actionable insights across cost, suppliers, compliance, and sustainability.The Power BI dashboards empower finance, procurement, and sustainability teams to make informed decisions, reduce waste, save cost, and achieve more responsible travel operations.
